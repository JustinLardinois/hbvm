hbvm (Haskell BASIL Virtual Machine) is a BASIL 2.0.0 compliant virtual
machine.

Build with gmake. Users of UNIX-like systems will have to change the variable
RM in makefile to rm, rather than the default del. Windows users should install
MinGW if they haven't already. It's included with Haskell, as far as I know.
